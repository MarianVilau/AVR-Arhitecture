# AVR-Arhitecture
 
In this repository, you will find some of the projects I have worked on during my AVR architecture learning journey. The hardware utilized was the **Atmel ATmega324PB_Xplained_Pro kit** with its two extensions. Resources related to schematics can be found in the "resource" folder. The development environment used was **IAR Embedded Workbench**. Additionally, for testing PWM and serial connections, a logic analyzer was employed.

## Acquired competencies:

- Basic knowledge of AVR architecture
- Debugging using assembly language concepts
- Working with various peripheral devices
- Implementation of custom libraries, avoiding the use of predefined or existing functions in well-known libraries to gain a deeper understanding of the processor's operation and facilitate future implementations
- Understanding the preprocessing mechanism of the code written for AtMega324PB
- Analysis and interpretation of logic signals
- Implementation of clean code and adherence to Embedded C notation conventions.
