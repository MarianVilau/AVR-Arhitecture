**Requirements for Light Intensity-Responsive LED Control:**

**362 - first version of this software**

1. **Objective:**
   Implement a light intensity-responsive LED control system based on four predefined ADC readings intervals to enhance user experience in varying lighting conditions.

2. **ADC Readings Intervals:**
   - **Interval 1:** Full Dark
   - **Interval 2:** Semi-Dark
   - **Interval 3:** Semi-Light
   - **Interval 4:** Full Light

3. **Light Intensity Correspondence:**
   - **Interval 1 (Full Dark):** All LEDs (LED1, LED2, LED3) should be turned off.
   - **Interval 2 (Semi-Dark):** LED1 should be turned on.
   - **Interval 3 (Semi-Light):** LED1 and LED2 should be turned on.
   - **Interval 4 (Full Light):** LED1, LED2, and LED3 should be turned on.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Utilize ADC readings to determine the current light intensity level.
   - Implement logic to control LEDs based on the specified intervals and corresponding light intensity states.
   - Ensure that the LED control system responds seamlessly to changes in light conditions.
   - Documentation should include instructions for setup and calibration to achieve optimal performance.

5. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Validate the system's responsiveness by testing it in various lighting conditions.
   - Ensure LEDs transition smoothly between states as per the specified intervals.

6. **Scalability:**
   - Design the system to allow for easy modification or expansion of ADC readings intervals and corresponding LED states to accommodate future enhancements or adjustments.

7. **Compliance:**
   - The implemented solution should comply with the defined requirements, providing a reliable and user-friendly light intensity-responsive LED control system.
